During the set, Tyler notably criticized VIP members in the audience, of which many were celebrities, and mocked television personality Kendall Jenner, telling her "fuck you", to which Jenner retaliated by "flipping the bird".

                                On 12 January 2015 the Prodigy released "Nasty" as the lead single off their upcoming album along with the title track on January 26, 2015. Howlett found that "violent is the word that keeps on coming up" when describing the album. The entire recording process took almost six years taking in a number of studios and a few restarts to establish that "angry, energetic sound”. Unlike previous efforts The Day Is My Enemy became a band-album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett. This created a degree of friction although Flint noted that “four years ago we sat down and talked about where the next album was gonna go, and we knew we had to bust out the most ‘band’ album we could create".

                                On 23 February 2015 the Prodigy released "Wild Frontier" as the second single off their upcoming album The Day Is My Enemy after announcing it three days earlier. The Stop-motion animation was directed by the Dutch filmmaker Mascha Halberstad and animator Elmer Kaan.The Cover Art was designed by Austrian artist and designer Moritz Resl.

                                The Soft Moon was founded by Vasquez as a solo project in 2009. He released two singles, "Breathe the Fire" and 	"Parallels", while working on his debut Self Titled LP. Prior to its release, Vasquez directed his energy into building a band around his project with the aim of delivering a full sensory experience within the context of live performance. The Soft Moon integrate visual elements on stage to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.

                                The group derives their name from the mythical and legendary animal known as the Rat king (folklore) which is actually a group of rats who have become conjoined by their tails via ice/ freezing, blood, dirt, horse hair, mucus, or other possibly binding substances found regularly in rat's habitats.

                                In February 2014, Action Bronson, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and 360, accompanied American hip hop superstar Eminem, on a brief tour of Australia and New Zealand. On May 6, 2014, Action Bronson debuted a food-oriented web series, titled Fuck, That's Delicious. The show is a VICE-sponsored monthly web series that chronicles the food-obsessed rapper's exploration of all things culinary. On May 16, 2014, Action Bronson announced the title of his major-label debut album, in a Twitter update, when he tweeted: "MY ALBUM BEEN NAMED. THE ONLY THING TO DESCRIBE ME.. MR. WONDERFUL. THATS BEEN ME SINCE I STEPPED IN THIS BULLSHIT.."

                                On August 5, 2014 Action Bronson released a song titled "Easy Rider", as the first single from his major-label debut album. The song was produced by Bronson's longtime producer Party Supplies. On August 20, 2014, the music video for "Easy Rider", was released. The video for "Easy Rider", which was directed by Tom Gould, pays homage to the 1969 Peter Fonda/Dennis Hopper film of the same name. A few days after announcing the completion of the album, on November 28, 2014, Bronson revealed there would be a worldwide concert tour upon the album's release. On December 24, 2014, Bronson took to Twitter to reveal the album would feature guest appearances from Meyhem Lauren, Big Body Bes, Party Supplies, Chauncy Sherod and Chance the Rapper. Later that day, after exposing several fake track-lists, Bronson tweeted 13 song titles, unveiling the album's official track-listing.

                                On January 7, 2015, Action Bronson revealed the album would be released on March 24. The following day on January 8, after releasing a song from the album titled "Actin Crazy", Bronson posted which artists would be featured on what song. On January 14, 2015, Bronson made an appearance on the New York City radio station Hot 97's Funkmaster Flex show, where he promoted Mr. Wonderful and performed a freestyle, which prompted Flex to declare Bronson the "nicest in the game right now." After premiering the song on January 7, 2015, Bronson officially released "Actin Crazy", via digital distribution on January 20. He released the full album on March 23, 2015.

                                Lamar has stated that Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, Nas and Eminem are his top five favorite rappers. Tupac Shakur is his biggest influence, and has influenced not only his music, but his day-to-day lifestyle as well. In a September 2012 interview, Lamar stated Detroit-based rapper Eminem "influenced a lot of my style" and has since credited Eminem for his own aggression on records, such as "Backseat Freestyle". Lamar also gave Lil Wayne (during his Hot Boyz days) credit for influencing his style and praised his longevity. He has said that he also grew up listening to Rakim, Dr. Dre and Tha Dogg Pound. He also cites Yonkers-based rapper DMX as an influence: "DMX really got me started on music," explained Lamar in an interview with Philadelphia's Power 99. "That first album [It's Dark and Hell Is Hot] is classic, [so he had an influence on me]." In January 2013, when asked to name three rappers that have played a role in his style, Lamar said: "It's probably more of a west coast influence. A little bit of Kurupt, Pac, with some of the content of Cube.” In a November 2013 interview with GQ, when asked "The Four MC's That Made Kendrick Lamar?", he answered Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Mobb Deep, namely Prodigy.

                                The band's music takes cues from Japanese noise rock bands such as Boredoms and Ruins, although composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra are acknowledged influences. The band's sound consists of Chippendale's frenetic drumming, his usually incomprehensible vocals, and Gibson's rhythmic bass guitar – an example of which is the song "13 Monsters", where Chippendale sings a playground style counting chant through heavy distortion over the instrumentals of his drums and Gibson's bass guitar. As for the band's genre, Brian Gibson is quoted as saying, "I hate, hate, hate the category "noise-punk" I really don't like being labeled with two words that have so much baggage. It’s gross."
                            </p>

                                As the group's vocalist, Chippendale eschews a conventional microphone, instead using the type of microphone built into a household telephone receiver, held in his mouth or attached to a mask, which is then run through an effects processor to further alter the sound. Chippendale has also used a KMD 8021 Drum Exciter, a simple drum-synth module, triggered by the bass drum.

                                Gibson plays his bass guitar tuned to cello standard tuning, in intervals of fifths (C G D A), using a banjo string for the high A. He used this four-string setup for several years, but has recently been seen using a five-string setup, tuned to C G D A E, with banjo strings for the A and E. Gibson also uses several effects pedals, including overdrive pedals, an octaver, a delay pedal, and a whammy pedal (pitch shifter).

                                The band's name is a reference to the Screamin' Jay Hawkins song "Yellow Coat". Darnielle released his first album, Taboo VI: The Homecoming, on Shrimper Records. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band The Casual Girls, who became known as The Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

                                The first five years of the Mountain Goats' career saw a prolific output of songs on cassette, vinyl and CD. These releases spanned multiple labels and countries of origin, often released in limited numbers. The focus of the Mountain Goats project was the urgency of writing. Songs not recorded adequately to tape within days of being written were often forgotten.
